### Architecture

<img src="images/dg/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/dg/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/dg/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/dg/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/dg/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/dg/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/dg/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/dg/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/dg/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/dg/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Mark Participation feature

#### Implementation

The `markp` command allows users to mark the participation score of students for a particular week. It takes in an index representing the index of the person to mark in the list, as well as a week number representing the target week to mark.

To better understand how the mark command is executed, below is a sequence diagram to provide a visual representation.

![MarkParticipationSequenceDiagram](assets/dg/MarkParticipationSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `MarkParticipationCommandParser` and `MarkParticipationCommand`should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

The sequence diagrams below provide information for the respective reference frames.

![MarkParticipation](assets/dg/SDMarkParticipation.png)

![CreateMarkCommandResult](assets/dg/SDMarkParticipationCommandResult.png)

![CommitAddressbook](assets/dg/SDMarkParticipationCommitAddressbook.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to mark a student's participation score:**

* **Current implementation:** Creates a new person with updated participation scores.
    * Pros: Ensures immutability of each person object, which reduces the potential for unintended side effects caused by mutable state changes.
    * Cons: May incur some performance overhead since we are creating a new copy of a person each time the command is called.

* **Alternative:** Update the participation field of the existing person object.
    * Pros: Will use less memory since we are not recreating a person object.
    * Cons: Person become mutable, which might be challenging to test and ensure correctness as the state changes constantly.

### Filter feature

#### Implementation

The `filter` command allows users to filter the currently shown list of students based on tags that match any of the specified tags given with
the command. It takes in the `filter` keyword as well as one or more alphanumeric tags separated by a space.

To better understand how the filter command is executed, below is a sequence diagram to provide a visual representation.

![FilterCommandSequenceDiagram](assets/dg/FilterCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FilterCommandParser` and `FilterCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

The sequence diagrams below provide information for the respective reference frames.

![FilterCommand](assets/dg/SDFilterStudents.png)

![FilterCommandResult](assets/dg/SDFilterCommandResult.png)

#### Design Consideration

**Aspect: How to filter the students shown by tag:**

* **Current implementation:** By using a PersonContainsTagPredicate, we update the filteredList in the Model which displays the students in the GUI.
    * Pros: Allows the filter command to use existing methods in the Model to filter the list of students. This reduces the negative side effects of the filter command.
    * Cons: The current implementation is dependent on the Model class and any bugs there renders the method useless.

* **Alternative:** By using a separate class to filter the students.
    * Pros: Reduces the dependency on the Model class and allows for easier testing of the filter command.
    * Cons: Requires additional classes to be created which may increase the complexity of the codebase.

### Grade Assignment feature

#### Implementation

The `grade` command allows users to assign a score to a particular student for a particular assignment. It takes in an index representing the index of the person to grade in the list, the name of the assignment to be graded, as well as a grade representing the grade to assign.

To better understand how the grade command is executed, below is a sequence diagram to provide a visual representation.

![GradeAssignmentSequenceDiagram](assets/dg/GradeAssignmentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `GradeAssignmentCommandParser` and `GradeAssignmentCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

The sequence diagrams below provide information for the respective reference frames.

![GradeAssignment](assets/dg/SDGradeAssignment.png)

![CreateGradeAssignmentCommandResult](assets/dg/SDGradeAssignmentCommandResult.png)

![CommitAddressbook](assets/dg/SDGradeAssignmentCommitAddressbook.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to grade a student for a specific assignment:**

* **Current implementation:** Creates a new person with updated assignment grade.
    * Pros: Ensures immutability of each person object, which reduces the potential for unintended side effects caused by mutable state changes.
    * Cons: May incur some performance overhead since we are creating a new copy of a person each time the command is called.

* **Alternative:** Update the assignment field of the existing person object.
    * Pros: Will use less memory since we are not recreating a person object.
    * Cons: Person become mutable, which might be challenging to test and ensure correctness as the state changes constantly.

**Aspect: Range and state of grades that can be assigned for an assignment:**

* **Current implementation:** Grades are defaulted to 0 upon the creation of an assignment, and are displayed as yellow text boxes.
    * Pros: Allows for easy visual distinction between assignments with 0 and nonzero grades.
    * Cons: Does not allow for distinction between assignments with grade 0 and ungraded assignments.

* **Alternative:** Implement a new state for assignments: ungraded, displayed as red text boxes.
    * Pros: Will allow for distinction between assignments with grade 0 and ungraded assignments.
    * Cons: Requires additional work by users to assign grades to ungraded assignments, since there would no longer be a default grade of 0.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList`, `commandResultList`, and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#commitInitial()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the initial address book state (upon initialisation) in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#getUndoneCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Fetches information about the command that was undone.
* `VersionedAddressBook#getRedoneCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Fetches information about the command that was redone.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`, `Model#redoAddressBook()`, `Model#getAddressBookUndoneCommand()`, and `Model#getAddressBookRedoneCommand()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state, saved with `VersionedAddressBook#commitInitial()`.

![UndoRedoState0](images/dg/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, the `CommandResult` of the delete command to be saved in `commandResultList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/dg/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/dg/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`. The command will also not be saved into `commandResultList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/dg/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/dg/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/dg/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state. It also returns information about the redone command through `Model#getAddressBookRedoneCommand()`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`, or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/dg/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. This is determined by calling `VersionedAddressBook#shouldPurge()`, and if there are future state to be purged, `VersionedAddressBook#purge()` will be called.

Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/dg/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/dg/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Current implementation:** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Add Assignment Feature

#### Implementation
The Add Assignment feature allows users to add assignments to users in nerdTrackerPlus. An Assignment is represented by
the Assignment class, which contains the assignment name and score. The command takes in a list of assignment
names then creates and adds a list of those assignments to the Assignment list of all users that do not already
have an assignment with the same name. The assignments are initiated with a score of 0 and saved to the storage file.

To better understand how the add assignment command is executed, below is a sequence diagram to provide a visual representation.

![AddAssignmentSequenceDiagram](assets/dg/AddAssignmentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddAssignmentCommandParser` and `AddAssignmentCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

The sequence diagrams below provide information for the respective reference frames.

![AddAssignment](assets/dg/SDAddAssignment.png)

![CreateAddAssignmentCommandResult](assets/dg/SDAddAssignmentCommandResult.png)

![CommitAddressbook](assets/dg/SDAddAssignmentCommitAddressbook.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to add assignments to students:**

* **Current implementation:** Creates a new person with updated assignment list.
    * Pros: Ensures immutability of each person object, which reduces the potential for unintended side effects caused by mutable state changes.
    * Cons: May incur some performance overhead since we are creating a new copy of a person each time the command is called.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative:** Update the assignment list of the existing person object.
    * Pros: Will use less memory since we are not recreating a person object.
    * Cons: Person becomes mutable, which might be challenging to test and ensure correctness as the state changes constantly.

**Aspect: How to handle duplicate Assignments:**

* **Current implementation:** Checks if the assignment already exists in the person's assignment list.
Adds the assignment if it does not exist. Duplicates are ignored as long as one person on the list does not have the assignment.
    * Pros: Ensures that duplicate assignments are not added to the person's assignment list.
    * Cons: Does not tell user which are ignored.

* **Alternative:** Checks if the duplicates exists in each person's assignment list, prompt user to confirm if they want to add the assignment.
    * Pros: Ensures that the user is aware of the duplicates and can decide if they want to add the assignment.
    * Cons: May be cumbersome for the user if they have many duplicates and have large student list.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**Team Size**: 4 members <br>

Given below are the planned future enhancements for our application.
Once the current version is stable, we plan to implement the following features:

1. Change unique identifier from Student Name to Student Matriculation Number

   * **Description**: Currently, the unique identifier for each student is generated based on the student's name.
   This can be problematic since the matriculation number is unique for each student, and it is possible for multiple students to have the same name. <br>

   * **Enhancement**: To resolve this, we plan to change the unique identifier of each student to be based on the student's
   matriculation number instead, since this is unique to each student.

   * **Example**: If a user adds a new student with name `Alex Yeoh` when `Alex Yeoh` already exists in nerdTrackerPlus, the command will successfully execute so long as their matriculation number is unique.

2. Setting participation scores

    * **Description**: Currently, `markp` and `markallp` commands as well as the corresponding unmark commands
only increment or decrement participation scores by 1. To set a students score to 3 for example,
the `markp` command must be executed multiple times.
This can be an inconvenient for teaching assistant who might want to increment scores by more than 1.<br>

    * **Enhancement**: We plan to modify `markp` commands and its variants to allow users to set specific scores instead of just incrementing it by 1.

    * **Example**: Users can now input `markp 1 3 s/5` to mark the participation score of the first student in week 3 to be 5 by specifying the score with the `s/` prefix.

3. Assignments to contain max score and weightage

   * **Description**: Currently, the **Assignment** class only contains the name of the assignment and the score obtained by
   the student. This does not allow for the calculation of the student's grade based on the assignment, as well as how
   much an assignment grade affects a student's total score.<br>

   * **Enhancement**: We can modify the Assignment class to contain **totalScore** and **weightagePercent** as Integer and Float fields respectively. These will be compulsory fields on the constructor and will be used to calculate the student's total score and grade.

   * **Example**: If `assignment1` has a maximum score of 100 and a student has scored 50 for that assignment, instead of displaying `assignment1` as `assignment1: 50`, it will be displayed as `assignment1: 50/100`.

4. Accept floats for scores

   * **Description**: Currently, the **assignmentScore** field in the **Assignment** class only accepts integers.
   This can be limiting as assignment scores might contain decimals.<br>

   * **Enhancement**: We plan to change the **assignmentScore** field to accept floats.

   * **Example**: Users can now input `grade 1 50.5 a/assignment1` to grade the first student's assignment1 score to 50.5.

5.  **unmarkalla** and **unmarkallp** commands should work as long as one student has a nonzero participation or attendance score

    * **Description**: Currently **unmarkallp** and **unmarkalla** commands will throw an error if one student has zero participation score or attendance score respectively. This makes their use case extremely narrow and limited. <br>

    * **Enhancement**: We plan to change this so that the commands will work as long as one student has a nonzero score.

    * **Example**: Suppose the first student in the list has a participation score of 0 for week 3, while the rest of the students have a score of 1. `unmarkp 3` will successfully unmark the participation score of all students in week 3 except for the first student.

6. **grade** command to allow setting of assignment score to 0

    * **Description**: Currently **grade** command only allows changing of assignment score to a non-zero positive integer.
This is limiting if the score needs to be changed to 0 to be ungraded. <br>

    * **Enhancement**: We plan to modify the **grade** command to allow users to grade an assignment score as 0.

    * **Example**: Users can now input `grade 1 0 a/assignment1` to grade the first student's assignment1 score to 0.

7. More robust error handling for `marka` and `markalla` commands

   * **Description**: Our `marka` and `markalla` commands currently do not have checks to see if the current student has already been marked before. If a user has issued the same `marka` command multiple times, this would result in a user needing to perform several `undo` commands to before being able to undo the `marka` command.

   * **Enhancement**: Throw an error if the user attempts to mark the attendance of a student who has already been marked before.

   * **Example**: If a user tries to mark a student who has already been marked before, an error message: `Student has already been marked` will be shown.

8. **filter** command to be case-sensitive

  * **Description**: Our filter command currently is case-insensitive, and users are unable to filter between 2 similar tags such as `G19Group1` and `g19group1`.

  * **Enhancement**: Modify filter command to be case-sensitive.

  * **Example**: Executing the command `filter cs2109s` would only filter students with tag `cs2109s`, even if some students have the tag `CS2109S`.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Ideation Phase

nerdTrackerPlus was created by a collective desire to fill a niche that the group was deeply familiar
with - supporting teaching assistants managing the administrative side of things so that they could focus
on the more important issue, teaching their classes.

Armed with this understanding of the target users, we leveraged our experiences and insights to
identify the unique challenges and requirements of teaching assistants.

We wanted to address the day-to-day hurdles faced by TAs, such as tracking attendance, monitoring
participation, managing assignments, and keeping track of the grades. The diversity of these challenges
highlighted the need for a versatile tool capable of streamlining these tasks.

At this point, we started drafting user stories that will serve as a foundation for the nerdTrackerPlus.
These stories were diverse, covering scenarios like a TA struggling to keep track of participation or
also difficulties in managing keeping track of the grades of the students for their different assignments.
From the set of user stories, we then carefully dissected them to extract key features that would allow
the nerdTrackerPlus effectively address the issues faced by the TAs.

From this process, we were able to successfully distill the first set of features, namely the edit,
removetags, filter and mark commands. With these basic commands, we were able to consult our peers and
professors for feedback.

We received many pieces of feedback that were extremely useful to the development of our project. Many
pieces of feedback allowed us to see the areas that we as the developers missed out on when we were
ideating for the application. Such examples included things like having a mark command to handle both
participation and attendance was confusing and unnecessary. Following this critical part of our
application's development, we decided on the new feature list and this resulted in a vast repertoire of a
total of 24 commands, all with the goal of addressing the issues faced by our user group.
This expansion in the commands allowed us to focus on the specific needs and we split each issue into
smaller parts. This allowed for a more comprehensive and meaningful feature set that is more robust in
tackling the issues faced by our user group.

### OOP Principles

nerdTrackerPlus was built upon the AB3 application so we already had a basis to start building upon.
However, to ensure that we are able to track the students, attendance, participation and assignments,
we introduced new classes that adhered to OOP principles that allowed us to extend the use cases of the
different classes that were already present. This can be seen from the creation of the
versionedAddressBook.java which allowed for the undo and redo commands to function. We also created
multiple classes for the different commands and updated the model to include Assignments (which includes
both the Assignment and the grade of the assignment).

Another example is in the filter command. The filter command differs from the find command as the filter
command is searching through the tags. Hence, it was vital for us to create a new
PersonContainsTagPredicate class to allow the filter command to search through the tags.
Many other examples of this exists in the different commands we have like the mark attendance and
mark participation commands. These commands are reflected directly onto the GUI so changes must be
incorporated into the existing code seamlessly and to do that, we had to first understand the existing
code before writing our own commands.

Finally, the last and most important thing was to incorporate our new features into the existing save and
load commands. We basically switched out the current implementation with our own implementation that saves
the updated information like the assignments, participation scores, attendance and also the student
(including the name, matric number, telegram handle and email address). This new implementation allows us to
parse all the information we want to save into a JSON file and because we created the new implementation
on storing, we also created the corresponding load functions to load the saved JSON data into the
application on initialisation.

### Built for Students, by Students

Our main focus for the nerdTrackerPlus was to create a seamless, integrated and efficient tool for
teaching assistants. To save time reduce the hassle from having too many GUI items, we chose a
Command Line Interface (CLI) approach to using our application.
This was also due to the fact that being Computer Science Teaching Assistants, our user group was highly
likely to be adept at using the CLI and would feel right at home with it compared to maybe a different
target audience.
The nerdTrackerPlus empowers our users to manage the academic details efficiently. The TAs can easily add
update, filter, mark both students and assignments easily, all in the application. This is helped by the
use of the index of displayed items for quick interactions. The find and filter commands are also
extremely helpful to the TAs, allowing them to quickly locate and update the necessary student or students.
We also have messages to reflect the status of a command, like SUCCESS or in the case of an error, we
would help the user by giving a sample use case and also show the parameters for the command. The help
command also directs the user to the user guide, enhancing the support for users.

### GUI updates

The most important GUI update is the color coded nature of our updated GUI. For participation and
attendance, if a student is missing in either, the corresponding field will be colored red to indicate an
absence or lack of participation and this will allow the teaching staff to easily identify who did not
participate or was absent. For assignments, the same color coding is applied, but with different colors to
differentiate the assignments with the attendance and participation scores.

### Testing

nerdTrackerPlus has a Testing Coverage of above 75% which is an indication of rigorous testing on the
part of the developer team. Having a high testing coverage is extremely important as it allows us to test
new code and see if the new code that we push may have any negative side effects.

### Software Engineering Practices

Our development process embraced rigorous software engineering practices. We adopted the standard format
in the course for clearer commit messages and enforced a review process requiring approval from at least
one team members for each pull request, enhancing code quality and team awareness.

We standardized pull request templates for detailed descriptions and checklists, ensuring thorough testing
and maintenance of code coverage standards. Additionally, we experimented with git workflows to optimize
productivity, employing both forking and feature workflows based on the nature of the task to facilitate
collaborative development and efficient integration of changes.
